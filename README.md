# project-form-Using-JavaFX
This project done for creating the project form submission for VIT Student Using javaFX and JDBC.
To Create this I have followed follwing steps:-
1. Create a new Java project in your IDE (Eclipse).

2. Add the JavaFX library to your project's classpath. You can do this by downloading the JavaFX SDK from the official website (https://openjfx.io/) and adding the necessary jar files to your project's build path. Alternatively, you can use a build tool like Maven or Gradle to manage your project dependencies.

3. Create a new JavaFX application class that extends the javafx.application.Application class. This class will be the entry point of your JavaFX application.

4. In the start() method of your JavaFX application class, create the main window of your application by creating an instance of the javafx.stage.Stage class.

5. Add user interface controls (such as buttons, labels, and text fields) to your main window by creating instances of the javafx.scene.control package classes.

6. Set up event handlers for your user interface controls to handle user interactions. For example, you can use the setOnAction() method of a button control to specify what happens when the button is clicked.

7. Run your JavaFX application by calling the launch() method of your JavaFX application class.
